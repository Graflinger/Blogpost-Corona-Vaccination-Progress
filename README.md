# Blogpost Corona Vaccination Progress

Repository for the Write-A-Data-Scientist project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree 

## Installation
This code was implemented using python 3.6.4

Used packages are:
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Project Motivation 
The motivation of this project was to dive deeper into the reasons why the covid-19 vaccine is distributed so unevenly between different countries.

Therefore I looked at different aspects, how countries differ.

I investigated if the progress in vaccination is related to the following information:
- How is the pandemic spreading in this country 
- How happy are the people in a certain country (World Happiness Report)
- How wealthy is a country
- In which part the country is located

## File Descriptions
All the code is located inside the code folder in a single Jupyter Notebook

The data is distributed between the single datasets which were used:

### Data/COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress
Here is the file country_vaccinations.csv saved.
